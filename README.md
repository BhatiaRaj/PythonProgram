# Python Program
1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Printout a message addressed to them
that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

2. Write a program to ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an
appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

3. Write a program as mentioned below:
Take a list, a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89], and write a program that print out all the elements of the list
that are less than 5.

4. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is
a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

5. Take two lists, a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89], b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and write a
program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

6. Write a program by asking the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A
palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

7. Write one line of Python that takes list a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100] and makes a new list that has
only the even elements of this list in it.

8. Write a program to make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input),
compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new
game)
Rules: Rock beats scissors, Scissors beats paper, Paper beats rock

9. Write a program to generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the
number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user
input lessons from the very first practical)
